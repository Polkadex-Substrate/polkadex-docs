## What is Polkadex?

Polkadex is a trading platform catered towards both the users of decentralized and centralized exchange markets. It provides two products initially, Polkadex Orderbook and Polkapool AMM. Polkadex Network allows traders to get the best of both worlds by providing a no KYC, feeless swaps and liquidity on AMM pool supported by perpetual liquidity mining program.
 
Polkadex Orderbook also improves the centralized exchange market by providing a non-custodial decentralized KYC'ed exchange based on orderboook and supporting fiat, institutional-grade liquidity and trading bots. In the nearest future, Polkadex Network will become a parachain in Polkadot Network opening the path towards assets in the Polkadot Ecosystem.
