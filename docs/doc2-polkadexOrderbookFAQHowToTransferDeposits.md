7. **Once the transfer is approved on Polkadex Parachain (in about a minute), your deposit will appear as ‘(1/2 Approved)’ on the ‘[Transactions](https://thea.polkadex.trade/transactions)’ page**, as **you still need to claim the deposit from the Polkadex parachain to complete the transfer** to the Polkadex network. You may need to ‘Refresh’ the ‘Transaction Log’ to see it.
8. **After your deposit is marked as ‘Approved’ in the [Transaction Log](https://thea.polkadex.trade/transactions), a ‘Claim Deposits’ button will appear** on the top right corner of the Transaction Log. **Click on ‘Claim Deposits’ to claim any of your unclaimed deposits** from the Polkadex parachain to your Polkadex network account and complete the deposit process.
9. **Navigate to the ‘[Balances](https://orderbook.polkadex.trade/balances)’ page on Polkadex Orderbook to see your deposit reflected in your Funding Account balance**.
10. **Finally, use the Orderbook transfer function in the ‘Balances’ page to transfer your newly added funds** from your Funding Account to your Trading Account in order to trade.
