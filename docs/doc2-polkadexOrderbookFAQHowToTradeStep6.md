4. **Select your asset** from the drop-down menu **and enter the transfer amount**. Confirm by clicking 'Transfer.'
5. **The transfer will immediately show as ‘Pending’ under the ‘History’ tab** at the bottom of the page. **After 1-2 minutes of block finalisation, it'll move to ‘Ready to Claim.’**
6. **You must manually claim the transfer by clicking the ‘Claim Now’ button next to the transaction**. (This manual claiming process is designed to prevent DDoS attacks and to avoid overwhelming the blockchain with numerous small transactions from malicious actors.)
7. **After a successful claim, the transaction details will be visible in the ‘Claimed’ section** of the ‘History’ tab.
8.**Your funds are now back in your blockchain account on Polkadex**. (To transfer funds to another blockchain from your account on the Polkadex chain, refer to the THEA guide in the subsequent section.)
