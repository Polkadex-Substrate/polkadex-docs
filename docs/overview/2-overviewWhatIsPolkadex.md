We believe that the optimal trading environment is very important for the growth of the crypto industry. Cryptocurrency trading has to be a secure and pleasant experience no matter if you are a novice, professional, retail or institutional trader.

The main idea behind Polkadex was to create a platform that would combine the benefits of centralized and decentralized exchanges into one cutting edge technology. Polkadex caters to any crypto trader. Our users wonâ€™t have to compromise on any part of the trading experience.

The goal of Polkadex is to create a fully decentralized platform for exchanging tokens in a peer-to-peer trustless environment, while additionally enabling high-liquidity, lightning-fast transaction speed and advanced trading features such as high-frequency trading and trading bots. Polkadex was bootstrapped by a Web3 Grant at the initial stage of the project to develop the original idea and was accepted as a member of DeFi Alliance.

At Polkadex we believe in the power of DeFi to set people all over the world free financially. That is why we pay great attention to making our platform very accessible and easy to use for crypto newbies. We are lowering entry barriers by focusing on UX and creating interoperable bridges to different liquidity sources including fiat support. Polkadex aims high at being the most convenient platform to buy, store and trade crypto assets.

Polkadex Orderbook is our core product that will also be enhanced by additional functionality. You can read about the details of each separate function that Polkadex will offer in this document.
