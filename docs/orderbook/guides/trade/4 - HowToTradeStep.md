2. **Click on "Buy" or "Sell"** in the top-right trading console, depending on your trading intention. In a BTC/USDT market, for example, a **"Buy" order means you are purchasing BTC with USDT**, whereas a **"Sell" order involves selling BTC for USDT**.
3. **To place a limit order, select "Limit Order"** from the top-right drop-down order picker. Then, set the price and quantity for your order. **Limit orders are filled once the market reaches the price you've set**.
4. **To place a market order, select "Market Order"** from the top-right drop-down order picker **and specify the amount you wish to buy or sell**. **Market orders fill existing limit orders and are executed instantly at the current market price**. The final price depends on the volume of the market order as it fills available limit orders.
5. When you're ready to execute the trade, click "**Trade**".
6.**At the bottom of the page, you can view your Open Orders, Order History, Trade History, and available Funds**.
