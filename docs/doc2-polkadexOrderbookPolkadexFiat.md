Polkadex Fiat will make Polkadex Orderbook a go-to decentralized exchange for users who are onboarded to crypto from traditional finance. Due to a no-KYC policy, none of the modern DEXes supports fiat, thus limiting access only to crypto holders. Polkadex will be one of the first projects to offer fiat support on a DEX thanks to the Decentralized KYC process.

Polkadex allows traders to:

* Buy crypto on the platform via a credit card or bank account.
* Receive tokens directly in the user's wallet automatically without manually moving funds as the exchange is non-custodial.
