Staking will incentivise users to hold PDEX in order to receive rewards in PDEX tokens. Staking is a mechanism for network validators. It will work in the same way as in the Polkadot network. It is based on the reward curve that will gamify the system. The goal is to keep 50% of the circulating supply of PDEX always staked.
