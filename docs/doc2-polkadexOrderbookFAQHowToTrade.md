2. Click on "Buy" or "Sell" in the top-right trading console, depending on your trading intention. In a BTC/USDT market, for example, a "Buy" order means you are purchasing BTC with USDT, whereas a "Sell" order involves selling BTC for USDT.
3. To place a limit order, select "Limit Order" from the top-right drop-down order picker. Then, set the price and quantity for your order. Limit orders are filled once the market reaches the price you've set.
4. To place a market order, select "Market Order" from the top-right drop-down order picker and specify the amount you wish to buy or sell. Market orders fill existing limit orders and are executed instantly at the current market price. The final price depends on the volume of the market order as it fills available limit orders.

4. Select your asset from the drop-down menu and enter the transfer amount. Confirm by clicking 'Transfer.'
5. The transfer will immediately show as ‘Pending’ under the ‘History’ tab at the bottom of the page. After 1-2 minutes of block finalisation, it'll move to ‘Ready to Claim.’
6. You must manually claim the transfer by clicking the ‘Claim Now’ button next to the transaction. (This manual claiming process is designed to prevent DDoS attacks and to avoid overwhelming the blockchain with numerous small transactions from malicious actors.)
7. After a successful claim, the transaction details will be visible in the ‘Claimed’ section of the ‘History’ tab.
8.Your funds are now back in your blockchain account on Polkadex. (To transfer funds to another blockchain from your account on the Polkadex chain, refer to the THEA guide in the subsequent section.)
