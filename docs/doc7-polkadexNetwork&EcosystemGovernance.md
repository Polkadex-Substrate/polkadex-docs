Polkadex network will use the governance mechanism of the Polkadot network. The governance is based on votes and their weight. Proposals will be submitted to on-chain governance and members will vote. Proposals will be approved or denied by the majority. You can read the detailed overview of how voting works here [https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance)

* Propose which assets to be listed in the exchange.
* Execute emergency shutdown of Polkadex Orderbook and oversee its actions
* Expenditure of Polkadex Treasury funds for ecosystem building
* Funds projects that build on top of Polkadex Network
* Controls Inflation of Polkadex Tokens
